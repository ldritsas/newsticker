# newsticker
Python3 code to display date and time and the current heaadlines from the NewsAPI service. I use Danilo Bargen's 'RPLCD' Character LCD library for the Hitachi HD44780 controller. https://github.com/dbrgn/RPLCD

the output is very simply a top line with the date and time, and the second line infinitely scrolls the news headlines.
